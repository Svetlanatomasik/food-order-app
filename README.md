# Food order app

Technologies that I used in the app:

-React

-CSS Modules

It's a food order app
where we got a list of meals from which we can choose.
And we can then add these meals to the cart,
also changed their amounts and also add them multiple times.
In “Your Cart” you can see your order list. Also there you 
can change your mind and add more meals to your order list or remove meals.
